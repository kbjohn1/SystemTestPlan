# SystemTestPlan
An STP tool that helps with keeping track of multiple projects and their respective black box testing statuses.

Software engineers are often working on multiple projects at once. Each project has its own system test plan (STP) and set of system test cases. In an attempt to eliminate the multiple documents, this STP tool will store STPs for multiple projects in one place.

System testing ignores the internals of the program and instead focuses on the inputs and the expected results of the program as defined by the requirements. System testing is also called functional testing, closed-box testing, and black-box testing. The tester treats the program as a “closed box”; the program implementation that generates the program output is unknown. The tester identifies the expected program output from the requirements and can compare the actual output with the expected output.

Each system test tracks four pieces of information: (1) test ID, (2) description, (3) expected results, and (4) actual results.
